## CTF Writeups

This is a collection of write-ups for the various CTFs (Capture The Flag) competitions I've attempted over the years.

In case you don't know what CTFs are, [ctftime.org](ctftime.org) defines it as follows:

> Capture the Flag (CTF) is a special kind of information security competitions. There are three common types of CTFs: Jeopardy, Attack-Defence and mixed.

I previously hosted these writeups at [gitbook.com](gitbook.com), but creating the writeups proved to be a headache since I prefer to do them during the competition and gitbook made that slightly annoying (They're also pivoting in a different direction).

If you want a local copy of these writeups run

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Jonw27/CTF_Writeups.git
```

### On Teaming
I'm currently looking for CTF teammates. I do mostly web with a bit of forensics. You can reach out to me at
